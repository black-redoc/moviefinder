        In 1970s London amidst the punk rock revolution, a young grifter named
        Estella is determined to make a name for herself with her designs. She
        befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief,
        and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets.
        One day, Estella’s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman,
        a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute. But their
        relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause
        Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and
        revenge-bent Cruella
